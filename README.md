## Introduction

Udacity's Intro to Machine Learning course (ud120) offers a comprehensive introduction to the world of machine learning. Throughout the course, students will learn about the basics of machine learning, including supervised and unsupervised learning, data preprocessing, and model evaluation. The course also covers several popular algorithms such as decision trees, support vector machines, and k-means clustering.

## Course Structure

The course is divided into the following sections:

1. **Lesson 1: Welcome to Machine Learning**
2. **Lesson 2: Naive Bayes**
3. **Lesson 3: Support Vector Machines**
4. **Lesson 4: Decision Trees**
5. **Lesson 5: Choosing Your Algorithm**
6. **Lesson 6: Regression**
7. **Lesson 7: Outliers and Anomalies**
8. **Lesson 8: Clustering**
9. **Lesson 9: Feature Scaling**
10. **Lesson 10: Validation and Evaluation**
11. **Lesson 11: Text Learning**

Each lesson contains lecture materials, quizzes, and programming exercises to reinforce the concepts learned.

## Installation

To run the code provided in this repository, you'll need to have Python 3 installed. Additionally, the following Python libraries are required:

- numpy
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib

You can install the necessary packages using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
```

Alternatively, you can use the `requirements.txt` file provided in the repository to install all dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Each lesson directory contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts corresponding to the specific topics covered in that lesson. To get started:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ud120-machine-learning.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd ud120-machine-learning
   ```

3. Open a Jupyter notebook server:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

4. Open the notebook for the lesson you wish to work on and follow the instructions provided within the notebook.

## Project Descriptions

### Project 1: Email Spam Detection

In this project, you will build a classifier to identify spam emails. You will preprocess the email data, extract features, and train a Naive Bayes classifier to categorise emails as spam or not spam.

### Project 2: Enron Fraud Detection

Using the Enron financial and email dataset, you will apply various machine learning algorithms to identify potential fraud within the Enron corporation. This project focuses on data cleaning, feature selection, and model evaluation.

### Project 3: Identify Customer Segments

This project involves using clustering algorithms to identify distinct customer segments based on purchasing behaviour. You will preprocess the data, apply k-means clustering, and interpret the results to gain insights into customer groups.
